This is an application that allows owners to match their dogs with other dogs to create relationships not only for the dogs, but for the owners as well.

=====================================================

Navigate to the project in your terminal and run "json-server -- watch db.json -- port=3001 (This will start the mock database running on port 3001)

-----------------------------------------------------

Now to start the app we will need to open another terminal and again navigate to the project within the terminal. This time you will run "npm start" which will start the application on port 3000.

-----------------------------------------------------

Now you can navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser and should be directed to the home page of the application.
